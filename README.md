# Code Smells Kata

**Smelly Tic Tac Toe**

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe. There are quite a few code smells in the implementation: 

* [Primitive Obsession](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/primitive-obsession)  : use of primitives instead of small objects for simple tasks (such as currency, ranges, special strings for phone numbers, etc.). **I'm not able to find this smell in this code.**
* [Feature Envy](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/feature-envy)              : method `Board()` of class `Board` accesses the data of class `Tile` more than its own data. *Solution:* [Extract Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-method), so make the constructor of class `Tile` and remove code from `Board()`. In addition, use [Move Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/move-method).
* [Data Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/data-class)                   : class `Tile` contains only fields and doesn't have any method at all, so it is simply a container for data used by other classes. *Solution:* first [Encapsulate Field](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/encapsulate-field), so put fields `private` and create getters and setters, then [Move Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/move-method)s, so find functionality that would be better located in the data class itself. Beware of [Encapsulate Collection](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/encapsulate-collection).
* [Message Chains](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/message-chains)          : in class `Game` the call `_board.TileAt(1, 0).Symbol` (performed a lot of times) is referring to a method of class `Board` which itself accesses a field of class `Tile`. *Solution:* [Hide Delegate](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/hide-delegate), so create method `returnSymbolInTileAt()` in class `Board`.
* [Long Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/long-method)             : in class `Game`, surely method `Winner()`, but also method `Play()`. *Solution:* [Extract Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-method).
* [Comments](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/comments)                 : in class `Game`, methods `Play()` and `Winner()`. *Solution:* [Extract Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-method)s into meaningful ones.
* [Long Parameter List](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/long-parameter-list)  : when a method takes as input more than three or four parameters. *Solution:* [Preserve Whole Object](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/preserve-whole-object), so pass the whole object to the method, instead of all its fields. **I'm not able to find this smell in this code.** Maybe the method `Play` in class `Game` could take as input a `Tile` instead of the four parameters, but then a player to do a move should first make a `Tile` and then call `Play()`, which seems unnecessary.
* [Shotgun Surgery](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/shotgun-surgery)       :  for example, if one has to change the name of the field `Symbol` in the class `Tile`, (s)he has to change all the three classes, since the field is directly accessed. *Solution:* create a getter method that takes care of accessing the field.
* [Duplicate Code](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/duplicate-code)         : massive duplication in method `Winner()` in class `Game`. *Solution:* [Extract Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-method)s and reuse them using calls.
* [Large Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/large-class)                 : surely class `Game`,  but also class `Board`. *Solution:* [Extract Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-class).
* [Divergent Change](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/divergent-change)     : for example, the class `Board` is set up for a $3 \times 3$ board, if one would do a bigger board (s)he has to do many changes throughout the code. *Solution:* code it in a way that lets you change one single variable to make a bigger board.
* [Data Clumps](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/data-clumps)              : different parts of the code contain identical groups of variables. **I'm not able to find this smell in this code.**
* [Lazy Class](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/lazy-class)                   : class `Tile`is too small and doesn't have any method. *Solution:* [Move Method](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/move-method)s, so find functionality that would be better located in the class itself. I wouldn't remove this class, since it is useful when class `Board` creates an `ArrayList` of `Tile`s.
* [Dead Code](https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/smells/dead-code)                 : the first four lines in method `AddTileAt()` are useless. *Solution:* remove them.

Start by identifying the smells and then slowly refactor the code. Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor. It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment.
